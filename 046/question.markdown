It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number
can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

$$\begin{aligned}
9 & = 7 + 2\times1^2 \\
15 & = 7 + 2\times2^2 \\
21 & = 3 + 2\times3^2 \\
25 & = 7 + 2\times3^2 \\
27 & = 19 + 2\times2^2 \\
33 & = 31 + 2\times1^2
\end{aligned}$$

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of
a prime and twice a square?
