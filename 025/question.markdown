The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

\\[F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2} | F_1 = 1 \and F_2 = 1.\\]

Hence the first 12 terms will be:

\\[
    \\begin{align*}
    F_1 &= 1
    \\\\ F_2 &= 1
    \\\\ F_3 &= 2
    \\\\ F_4 &= 3
    \\\\ F_5 &= 5
    \\\\ F_6 &= 8
    \\\\ F_7 &= 13
    \\\\ F_8 &= 21
    \\\\ F_9 &= 34
    \\\\ F_10 &= 55
    \\\\ F_11 &= 89
    \\\\ F_12 &= 144
    \\end{align*}
\\]

The 12th term, \\(F_12\\), is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
