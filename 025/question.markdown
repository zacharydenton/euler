The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \text{ where } F_1 = 1 \text{ and } F_2 = 1$$

Hence the first 12 terms will be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_1 &= 1 \\
F_2 &= 1 \\
F_3 &= 2 \\
F_4 &= 3 \\
F_5 &= 5 \\
F_6 &= 8 \\
F_7 &= 13 \\
F_8 &= 21 \\
F_9 &= 34 \\
F_{10} &= 55 \\
F_{11} &= 89 \\
F_{12} &= 144
\end{aligned}
$$

The 12th term, $F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
