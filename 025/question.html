<p>
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
</p>

\[F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2} | F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1\]

<p>
Hence the first 12 terms will be:
</p>

\[
\begin{aligned}
F_1 & = 1 \\
F_2 & = 1 \\
F_3 & = 2 \\
F_4 & = 3 \\
F_5 & = 5 \\
F_6 & = 8 \\
F_7 & = 13 \\
F_8 & = 21 \\
F_9 & = 34 \\
F_{10} & = 55 \\
F_{11} & = 89 \\
F_{12} & = 144
end{aligned}
\]

<p>
The 12th term, \(F_{12}\), is the first term to contain three digits.
</p>

<p>
What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
