<p>Consider all integer combinations of \(a^b\) for \(2 \leq a \leq 5\) and \(2 \leq b \leq 5\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
2^2 & = 4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32 \text{(etc.)} \\
3^2 & = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243} \\
4^2 & = 16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, 4^5=1024} \\
5^2 & = 25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125} \\
\end{aligned}
\]

<p>
If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we 
get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:
</p>

\[4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125\]

<p>
How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by \(a^b\) for 
\(2 \leq a \leq 100\) and \(2 \leq b \leq 100\)?
</p>
