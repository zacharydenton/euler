A googol ($10^{100}$) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred
zeros; $100^{100}$ is almost unimaginably large: one followed by
two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each
number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, $ab$, where $a, b < 100$, what
is the maximum digital sum?
