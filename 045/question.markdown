Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the
following formulae:

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Triangle} & T_n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2} & 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... \\
\text{Pentagonal} & P_n=\frac{n(3n-1)}{2} & 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ... \\
\text{Hexagonal} & H_n=n(2n-1) & 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...
\end{aligned}$$

It can be verified that $T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755$.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
