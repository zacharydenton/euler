<p>
A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.
</p>

<p>For example,</p>

\[
\begin{aligned}
&amp; 44 \rightarrow 32 \rightarrow 13 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 1 \\\\
&amp; 85 \rightarrow 89 \rightarrow 145 \rightarrow 42 \rightarrow 20 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 37 \rightarrow 58 \rightarrow 89
\end{aligned}
\]

<p>
Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.
</p>

<p>
How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?
