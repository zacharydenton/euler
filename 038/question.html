<p>
Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:
</p>

\[
\begin{aligned}
192 × 1 &amp; = 192 \\
192 × 2 &amp; = 384 \\
192 × 3 &amp; = 576
\end{aligned}
\]

<p>
By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3).
</p>

<p>
The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).
</p>

<p>
What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with \(1,2,\dots,n\) where \(n &gt; 1\)?
</p>
