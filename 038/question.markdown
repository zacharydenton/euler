Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

$$\begin{aligned}
192 \times 1 & = 192 \\
192 \times 2 & = 384 \\
192 \times 3 & = 576
\end{aligned}$$

By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576.
We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3).

The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3,
4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated
product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).

What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed
as the concatenated product of an integer with $1,2,\dots,n$ where
$n > 1$?
