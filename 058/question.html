<p>Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.</p>

<pre><code><span style="color:#ff0000;">37</span> 36 35 34 33 32 <span style="color:#ff0000;">31</span>
38 <span style="color:#ff0000;">17</span> 16 15 14 <span style="color:#ff0000;">13</span> 30
39 18  <span style="color:#ff0000;">5</span>  4  <span style="color:#ff0000;">3</span> 12 29
40 19  6  1  2 11 28
41 20  <span style="color:#ff0000;">7</span>  8  9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 26
<span style="color:#ff0000;">43</span> 44 45 46 47 48 49
</code></pre>

<p>It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of $\frac{8}{13} \approx 62%$.</p>

<p>If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?</p>
