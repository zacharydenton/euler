<p>
The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.
</p>

\[
\sqrt{2} = 1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \dots}}}}}
\]

<p>
The infinite continued fraction can be written, \(\sqrt{2} = [1;(2)]\), (2) indicates that 2 repeats <em>ad infinitum</em>. In a similar way, \(\sqrt{23} = [4;(1,3,1,8)]\).
</p>

<p>
It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for \(\sqrt{2}\).
</p>

\[
\begin{aligned}
1 + \frac{1}{2} &amp; = \frac{3}{2} \\\\
1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2}} &amp; = \frac{7}{5} \\\\
1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2}}} &amp; = \frac{17}{12} \\\\
1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2}}}} &amp; = \frac{41}{29}
\end{aligned}
\]

<p>
Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for \(\sqrt{2}\) are:
</p>

\[
1, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{7}{5}, \frac{17}{12}, \frac{41}{29}, \frac{99}{70}, \frac{239}{169}, \frac{577}{408}, \frac{1393}{985}, \frac{3363}{2378}, \dots
\]

<p>
What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,
\(e = [2; 1,2,1, 1,4,1, 1,6,1 , \dots , 1,2k,1, \dots]\).
</p>

<p>
The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for \(e\) are:
</p>

\[
2, 3, \frac{8}{3}, \frac{11}{4}, \frac{19}{7}, \frac{87}{32}, \frac{106}{39}, \frac{193}{71}, \frac{1264}{465}, \frac{1457}{536}, \dots
\]

<p>
The sum of digits in the numerator of the \(10^{th}\) convergent is \(1+4+5+7=17\).
</p>

<p>
Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the \(100^{th}\) convergent of the continued fraction for \(e\).
</p>
