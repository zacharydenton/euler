Euler's Totient function, $\varphi(n)$ [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to $n$ which are relatively prime to $n$. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, $\varphi(9)=6$.
The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so $\varphi(1)=1$.

Interestingly, $\varphi(87109)=79180$, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.

Find the value of $n$, $1 \lt n \lt 10^7$, for which $\varphi(n)$ is a permutation of $n$ and the ratio $\frac{n}{\varphi(n)}$ produces a minimum.
