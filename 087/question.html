<p>The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power is 28. In fact, there are exactly four numbers below fifty that can be expressed in such a way:</p>
<p>28 = 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup><br />
33 = 3<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup><br />
49 = 5<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup><br />
47 = 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>How many numbers below fifty million can be expressed as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power?</p>
