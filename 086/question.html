<p>A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring 6 by 5 by 3, and a fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces of the room the shortest &quot;straight line&quot; distance from S to F is 10 and the path is shown on the diagram.</p>

<p>However, there are up to three &quot;shortest&quot; path candidates for any given cuboid and the shortest route doesn't always have integer length.</p>
<p>It can be shown that there are exactly 2060 distinct cuboids, ignoring rotations, with integer dimensions, up to a maximum size of M by M by M, for which the shortest route has integer length when M = 100. This is the least value of M for which the number of solutions first exceeds two thousand; the number of solutions when M = 99 is 1975.</p>
<p>Find the least value of M such that the number of solutions first exceeds one million.</p>
