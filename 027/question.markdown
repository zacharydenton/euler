Euler published the remarkable quadratic formula:

$$n^2 + n + 41$$

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes 
for the consecutive values n = 0 to 39. However, when 
n = 40, $40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$ is divisible 
by 41, and certainly when n = 41, $41^2 + 41 + 41$ is 
clearly divisible by 41.

Using computers, the incredible formula  $n^2 - 79n + 1601$
was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the 
consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The product of the 
coefficients, 79 and 1601, is 126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:

$$n^2 + an + b, \text{ where } |a| < 1000 \text{ and } |b| < 1000$$

Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for 
the quadratic expression that produces the maximum 
number of primes for consecutive values of n, 
starting with n = 0.
