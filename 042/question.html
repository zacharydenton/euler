<p>
The $n^{th}$ term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, $t_n = \frac{1}{2}n(n+1)$; so the first ten triangle numbers are:</p>

$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \dots$$

<p>By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is $19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_{10}$. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.</p>

<p>Using <a href="http://projecteuler.net/project/words.txt">words.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?</p>
