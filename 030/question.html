<p>
Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be 
written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
</p>

\[
\begin{aligned}
1634&amp;=1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 \\\\
8208&amp;=8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4 \\\\
9474&amp;=9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4
\end{aligned}
\]

<p>
As \(1=1^4\) is not a sum it is not included.
</p>

<p>
The sum of these numbers is \(1634+8208+9474=19316\).
</p>

<p>
Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as 
the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
