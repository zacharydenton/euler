Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be 
written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

$$\begin{aligned}
1634&=1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 \\
8208&=8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4 \\
9474&=9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4
\end{aligned}$$

As $1=1^4$ is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is $1634+8208+9474=19316$.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as 
the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
