The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. By taking any two
primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be
prime. For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The
sum of these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of
four primes with this property.

Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes
concatenate to produce another prime.
